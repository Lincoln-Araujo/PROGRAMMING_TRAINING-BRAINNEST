        <p>Go out for a walk in the end of the day is something that I love to do.</p>
        <p>But, some days a I'm full of energy and do walks a little more audacious.</I></p>

                <h2>Walking in the city</h2>
                <p>Walking between buildings and houses is somehting that I do constantly.</p>
                <p>It's a perfect way to relax in the end of the day and organize all my thoughts after a long day.</p>
                <p>It also the best way to know new places when I'm travelling.</p>
            <p></p>

                <h2>Walking in the woods</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, mainly when I'm feeling stressed, hiking in the woods is the best way to relax.</p>
                <p>This is also a chance for appreciating some nature.</p>
                <p>But also a little dangerous depdending on the day time.</p>
            <p></p>

            <li>
                <h2>Walking in the mountains</h2>
                <p>I can't say this is the best kind of walk (IT IS!), but I always have the best experiences when I do them.</p>
                <p>I love the feeling of you seeing everything from the top of a mountain.</p>
